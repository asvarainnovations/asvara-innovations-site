# **Income Tax in India Post-2025: Comparative Study of the Old and New Regimes**

---

## **Introduction**

India’s tax framework currently provides **two parallel regimes**. Under **Section 115BAC** of the *Income-tax Act, 1961*, the **new (default) regime** imposes **lower tax rates** but restricts most deductions; the **old (optional) regime** retains higher rates while allowing a wide range of exemptions and deductions.

* **New regime:** favors simplicity and lower marginal rates.

* **Old regime:** benefits taxpayers who claim sizable tax breaks.

The **Finance Act, 2024** made the new regime the **default** for individual taxpayers, though one may opt out into the old regime each year. Unless a taxpayer actively chooses the old regime on their return, **the new slabs and rules automatically apply**.

“Various deductions and exemptions are allowed in the old tax regime. The new regime offers lower rates of taxes but permits limited deductions and exemptions.”  
 — *Income Tax Department (official summary)*

---

## **Critical Analysis**

### **Old Regime (Pre-2025)**

* Basic exemption: **₹2.5 lakh** (for under-60 individuals).

* Tax rates:

  * 5% on ₹2.5–5 L

  * 20% on ₹5–10 L

  * 30% on income above ₹10 L

### **New Regime (Before 2025 Revisions)**

* Basic exemption: **₹3 lakh**

* Tax rates:

  * 5% on ₹3–7 L

  * 10% on ₹7–10 L

  * Higher slabs followed thereafter

### **Deductions and Allowances**

**Old regime** allows:

* Section 80C: ₹1.5 L (investments)

* Section 80D: ₹25–50 k (health insurance premiums)

* Section 80TTA: ₹10 k (savings account interest)

* HRA, LTA, and others

**New regime** disallows most of these, except:

* Standard deduction for salary (₹75,000 from FY2025-26)

* Employer NPS contributions (up to 14% of salary)

**Summary:**

* Taxpayers with **fewer deductions** (e.g., small investors, pure salaried workers) benefit from the **new regime’s lower rates**.

* Those with **major deductions** (e.g., home loans, large investments) may prefer the **old regime**.

## **Impact of Changes on Various Income Levels**

### **1\. Low to Middle Income (Up to ₹12 L)**

* Fully tax-free under new regime due to the **₹12 L rebate**.

* Example:

  * Income ₹10 L → ₹0 tax under new regime.

  * Under old regime → approx ₹1.125 L tax (5% \+ 20%).

### **2\. Middle-High Income (₹12–24 L)**

* Lower rates compared to the old regime:

  * 15% on ₹12–16 L (was 20%)

  * 20% on ₹16–20 L (was 30%)

  * 25% on ₹20–24 L (new intermediate slab)

* Savings examples (Govt & ET):

  * ₹12 L → save ₹80,000

  * ₹18 L → save ₹70,000

  * ₹25 L → save ₹1,10,000

### **3\. High Income (Above ₹24 L)**

* Top rate remains **30%**, but applies only beyond ₹24 L (earlier ₹10 L).

* Example:

  * ₹30 L income → only ₹6 L taxed @30%.

  * Previously, ₹20 L was taxed @30%.

* **Effective tax rate falls** for upper-middle and high earners.

### **4\. Policy Intent**

“To put more money in the hands of the middle class.” — *Finance Minister*

Analysts (e.g., **KPMG**) highlight that the 2025 Budget offers **stability** and **simplification**, favoring the default new regime.

## **Changes in Deductions and Rebate**

### **Section 87A Rebate**

* **Raised to ₹60,000** in 2025\.

* Applies to “regular” income (salary, rent, etc.); **capital gains** remain separately taxed.

### **Deductions**

* **New regime:**

  * Standard deduction (₹75,000)

  * Employer NPS (14%)

  * No new deductions in 2025

* **Old regime:**

  * Continues with 80C, 80D, HRA, LTA, etc.

  * New provision: **Parents’ contribution to child’s NPS Vatsalya** account eligible for ₹50,000 deduction under **80C** (in addition to ₹1.5 L).

---

## **Overall Impact and Legal Context**

* **Simplification:** Encourages migration to a cleaner, default tax system.

* **Relief:** Higher exemption \+ rebate benefit \= more disposable income.

* **Legal Reform:**

  * The new *Income-tax Act, 2025* consolidates and modernizes procedures.

  * Reduces law volume from **823 to 536 sections**.

  * Adds reforms such as **faceless assessments** and **time-bound refunds**.
