# Women & Political Backwardness

---

## Abstract

This research examines the complex network of issues that lead to women's political backwardness in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, two Indian states with dynamic political environments. Through the use of an in-depth investigation technique that integrates a doctrinal approach with quantitative data analysis, the study makes its way through conceptual frameworks, historical paths, and present political realities.

The four fundamental pillars of political backwardness — **education, language divide, gender inequality, and reservation** — serve as a compass that sheds light on the socio-political limitations that women must contend with. The significant gender gaps are highlighted by a quantitative evaluation, which also makes clear the urgent need for focused efforts. The research proposes joint endeavors among politicians, community organizations, and the general public to undermine deeply ingrained gender stereotypes and create a welcoming political atmosphere.

The results provide a set of subtle suggestions aimed at guaranteeing a representative and equal democratic culture in the future by promoting political engagement that is gender neutral.

## Introduction

Any healthy democracy must have effective political representation, but women in Indian states like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh still struggle with political backwardness and face obstacles that prevent them from actively participating in governance. Using a thorough research technique that combines a doctrinal approach with quantitative data analysis, this study explores the many facets of women's political engagement.

We may learn a great deal about the socio-political factors that have created the present situation by looking at the historical development of the political landscapes in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The numerical evaluation of women's political representation is an alarming indicator of the gender gaps that still exist in these states.

The relatively low number of female candidates is proof that cultural expectations and deeply established gender norms continue to create barriers for women seeking political office. The report emphasizes how urgent it is to implement focused initiatives, change the law, and raise public awareness to remove these obstacles and promote an inclusive political environment.

The political backwardness conceptual framework clarifies the complex issues that women in these states face and acts as an example of hope. Beyond the spheres of education and the economy, political backwardness covers the unequal distribution of resources and structural imbalances that perpetuate inequality.

The research provides a thorough grasp of the complex processes at play by recognizing four essential pillars — **reservation, education, linguistic divide, and gender inequality** — as critical indicators for assessing political backwardness. It is clear from combing through the study's results that confronting political backwardness requires a comprehensive strategy. The next sections will discuss specific suggestions and conclusions that were drawn from a comprehensive examination of the study results. The goal is to pave the road for women in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh to have a more representative and equitable political future.

## Research Methodology

The right research method is very important for properly analyzing any study. For every study to be carried out, there needs to be a well-thought-out plan. To get accurate results, it's important to choose the right research method. The researcher will use both the **doctrinal approach** and **quantitative analysis of secondary data** to finish this research project.

Several different research methods are used to compare how politically backward women are in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. An in-depth review of the literature is needed to understand what is known about women's political participation in India, especially in the two states that are the focus of a doctrinal study. The study's goal is to get an unbiased look at how many women vote by using official government data from the Election Commission and other sources.

To find trends and differences, the study first looks at how the political systems, laws, and cultures of each state are similar and different. The study also has a policy analysis that looks at current programs that help women get into politics and makes suggestions for how they could be improved. Ethical concerns about the study process need to be thought through to protect the privacy and openness of the participants. We can learn more about why women are less likely to vote in both areas by looking at the situation from a wider perspective.

## Conceptual Framework of Political Backwardness

Using the theoretical structure of political backwardness as a way to go through it and a way to make sure that researchers and decision-makers can better understand the complex nature of political limitation within a society. The word **"Political Backwardness"** explains the wide range of socio-political matters that prohibit anyone from taking an active part in political affairs and engaging in the process. It travels beyond the range of education or any other aspect of economic issues. The limited access to political resources and the injustice caused by the fundamentals of the institution and its system.

Some groups of people or communities may become caught in a vicious cycle of marginalization whereby past wrongs, discriminatory actions, and institutional biases prevent them from completely exercising their political rights. Political disadvantage is maintained by these inequalities, which take many different forms, including unequal access to social networks, financial resources, and educational opportunities.

Assessing participation and representation in political bodies is a crucial component of the conceptual framework of political backwardness. The ongoing underrepresentation of particular groups, despite their gender, race, socioeconomic status, or other characteristics, is known as political regression. Due to their underrepresentation, marginalized groups frequently experience political disadvantage as a result of decisions and policies that fall short of meeting their needs and concerns.

Political backwardness mainly can be measured on the **four pillars** which are crucial to declare a particular area or state as politically backward:

1. Reservation  
2. Education  
3. Linguistic Division  
4. Gender Inequality

The term backwardness refers to the lack of progress by a person or a group to some specific cultural norms and group. One example can be those states that are not advanced and not using modern methods along with the states that have made less progress than normal whereas political is connected with the governance and working models of the country.

## A Historical Review of Politics in Uttarakhand (UK) and Himachal Pradesh (HP)

### Uttarakhand (UK)

Formerly, the area that is now known as Uttarakhand was a part of British India's United Provinces. The demand for a separate state for the hilly parts of Uttar Pradesh grew during the post-independence period. The state of Uttar Pradesh was so large that elected politicians were not paying attention to the development of hilly regions, which resulted in multiple public demonstrations in support of the Uttarakhand Kranti campaign. These factors, along with the state's challenging terrain, distinctive culture, and socioeconomic disparities, all contributed to the push for a distinct identity. The campaigners emphasized the unique economy and culture of the area.

The northern portion of Uttar Pradesh was divided to create Uttarakhand, which became the **27th state of the Indian Union on November 9, 2000**. Dehradun was selected to serve as the temporary capital. In the more than 21 years since it became a state, Uttarakhand has seen significant political upheaval, including changes in the government. The hill state has had eleven chief ministers despite only four Assembly elections, demonstrating the fluidity of its political environment. Voters in Uttarakhand have frequently alternated between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National Congress since the state's first assembly elections in 2002.

Uttarakhand's political system is based on a parliamentary system of government, similar to the federal system. The Chief Minister is in charge of the executive branch, and the state legislature, which consists of the Legislative Assembly, is a unicameral body. Uttarakhand's political situation has been shaped by coalition politics as well, with alliances and realignments having an impact on the establishment and stability of administrations. The distinct topography and cultural heterogeneity of Uttarakhand also impact the state's political atmosphere. Politicians must negotiate a variety of identities, including those of Garhwal and Kumaon, to establish effective government.

### Himachal Pradesh (HP)

Before India's independence in 1947, Himachal Pradesh was a crucial part of the princely state of Punjab. The present state's constituent regions have historical, cultural, and administrative ties to the larger Punjab region because of this physical union. As the journey proceeded, Himachal Pradesh stayed a part of the broader Punjab following the 1956 linguistic reorganization of states. However, this administrative framework did not account for the distinct linguistic, cultural, and geological characteristics of the Himalayan region. The linguistic reformation, which was primarily concentrated on lowland areas, led to a growing sense of regional inequality, leaving Himachal Pradesh's hilly districts underrepresented. This situation ultimately paved the way for Himachal Pradesh's aspiration for independence.

The locals began to voice their desire for a distinct identity, emphasizing the need for a localized government to address the specific issues caused by the region's unusual socioeconomic conditions and steep topography. Over time, the statehood movement gained momentum, with political engagement and campaigning being crucial in communicating the regional objectives and creating support for an independent administrative body.

In **1971**, Himachal Pradesh was admitted as the **18th state of the Indian Union** following decades of demands for statehood. Because Himachal Pradesh is a state representative of India's larger parliamentary system of government, it shares many political characteristics with Uttarakhand. The primary legislative body is the unicameral Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister is a key figure in state government, overseeing the executive branch. Since its founding, Himachal Pradesh has experienced a dynamic political climate characterized by the periodic rotation of political power between major national parties, primarily the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party.

## Women’s Representation in UK & HP Politics: A Quantitative Assessment

Women's participation in politics shows a community is accessible and is an important component of democratic governance. The Indian states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh are outstanding instances of dynamic political representation and participation. To throw light on the opportunities and obstacles that affect women's political trajectories in these two states, a statistical analysis of the pertinent data records was done for this study.

Gender norms are deeply ingrained in these two states, impacting the political and social spheres and making life challenging for women. Traditional gender norms usually limit women to domestic duties, which lessens their visibility and power in society. Patriarchal ideas are ingrained in society and discourage women from actively participating in politics. These ideas can manifest as overt or covert forms of discrimination. To topple these deeply ingrained customs, legislative action is required, but changing public attitudes about women's leadership roles also requires focused effort.[^4]

Social norms and assumptions about women's roles have a big influence on their political careers. Women who enter politics may face resistance or criticism because of enduring beliefs that question their ability to balance obligations to their families and politics. These expectations might discourage female leaders in the future or present new challenges for those already working in politics. Campaigns that challenge stereotypes and promote positive narratives about women in the field are essential to shifting public perceptions and encouraging more women to enter politics.

> According to the total number of candidates examined by recent data, only **10% of women from Uttarakhand** and **6% from Himachal Pradesh** have actively participated in elections.[^5][^6] The aforementioned data demonstrates a significant gender disparity in political representation and emphasizes the need for targeted programs designed to encourage and facilitate greater female involvement in the political process.

### Figures & District Data

> **Fig. 1**

> **Fig. 2**  
> *(figure placeholder from original PDF)*

The state of Uttarakhand has a substantial female population, totaling **4,948,519**. However, the stark underrepresentation of female candidates suggests that barriers still exist, limiting their ability to enter and advance in the political sphere. These might include a lack of funds, deeply embedded social norms, or challenges negotiating the complex terrain of political campaigns. There are **62 female candidates out of 626 total** (Uttarakhand), and district-specific data (Fig. 3) allows analysis of the discrepancy between female candidates and the district's overall female population.

> **Fig. 3 — Uttarakhand**  
> *(district-wise candidate vs population figure placeholder)*

In all, **3,382,729 women** are thought to reside in Himachal Pradesh. The low number of female candidates suggests that structural barriers may persist in the state despite the large number of women living there. Many barriers, such as financial limitations, societal norms and expectations, and limited access to resources, are responsible for the underrepresentation of women in positions of political decision-making. There are **24 female candidates out of 412** (Himachal Pradesh), and Fig. 4's representation of district-specific data allows analysis of the discrepancy between the district's overall female population and its female candidates.

> **Fig. 4 — Himachal Pradesh**  
> *(district-wise candidate vs population figure placeholder)*

To address the imbalance in women's political participation, we must look into the root causes of these issues. Gender norms and cultural standards can discourage women from actively pursuing employment in politics because they often mandate traditional roles for women in the home. Obstacles such as unbalanced access to political relationships, financial resources, and educational opportunities may impede women's entry into politics.

A range of strategies, including capacity-building initiatives, legislative modifications, and public awareness campaigns, should be employed to increase the representation of women in Himachal Pradesh. To promote a more representative and inclusive democracy, an environment that empowers women to surmount these obstacles must be established. Closing the gender gap in political participation would reinforce the democratic fabric as the state grows by incorporating a range of opinions and views in decision-making processes.

Statistics show that men and women in Himachal Pradesh differ greatly in terms of participation in state politics and holding public office; this is an area that needs a lot more focus.[^9]

## Current Scenario and Lacunas of Political Backwardness

In terms of political representation, women do not enjoy a particularly privileged position in either state which makes it more crucial for the government to take necessary action. As a result of the approval of the women's reservation bill in Parliament and the requests of certain politicians to ensure that OBC women are guaranteed internal reservation, the demand for political reservation for OBCs has become more intense.

At this time, only the municipal and urban levels offer political reservations for people who are considered to be on the OBC list. Nevertheless, it is entangled in a complex web of legal complications as a consequence of the ruling of the Supreme Court, which mandates the establishment of empirical data to support any OBC quota.

The most recent few Indian elections have been very different from each other. There was an increase in the number of women voters in seven of the eight states which held elections in 2022. In other words, more women are now voting over men. Even though this seems like a good thing, the rise in the number of women voting in local, state, and national elections has not led to more women running for office. Because of this, it is very important to remove the barriers that keep women from taking part in politics. Policymakers, civil society groups, and regular people will all need to work together to reach the goal of gender equality and make sure that women have the same chances as men to actively participate in politics.

The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has compiled data indicating that women comprise **14.44% of the 17th Lok Sabha in India**. Furthermore, as of **October 2021**, **10.5% of all Members of Parliament were women**, according to the Election Commission of India's (ECI) most recent report. Nine percent of all state assemblies are thought to consist of female members of the legislature (MLAs). Over the previous few years, India's ranking has been dropping in this regard. It is currently doing worse than Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan.

Because the participation rate of women is low enough, there are several public service jobs at the center and in the states that allow female candidates to submit their applications for free. However, as per the information furnished by the Indian Administrative Services (IAS) and the central government's 2011 employment census, less than **11%** of its entire workforce was female workers. By **2020**, this percentage had risen to **13%**. Furthermore, only **14% of Secretaries** employed by the Indian Administrative Service were female in **2022**. There are just **three female chief secretaries** in all of the states and union territories of India. In India, there has never been a female cabinet secretary.[^10]

## Recommendation & Conclusion

This study concludes by highlighting the political backwardness that women in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh endure. Additionally, it emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive policies to address gender gaps in political representation. One can gain a better understanding of the socio-political factors that have contributed to the current situation by first acquiring an understanding of the historical history of both the state and the nation.

In addition to showing the continuous existence of structural impediments such as cultural norms, monetary limits, and restricted resource availability, the quantitative study demonstrates that women are underrepresented in political positions. Focusing on pillars such as reservation, education, linguistic divide, and gender imbalance, the theoretical underpinning of political backwardness provides a thorough explanation of the challenges that women face in these states.

To solve these difficulties, the solutions center on building political reservations, supporting policy changes, expanding capabilities, and boosting public awareness all at the same time. There is a need for collaboration between governments, community groups, and the general public to cultivate an environment that encourages women to participate actively in political processes. The achievement of gender parity in political involvement is not only a concern of fairness, but it also contributes to the development of democracies that are representative and inclusive.

The government should set up committees or a neutral monitoring mechanism that excludes family members from affecting the choices made by women candidates to promote the representation of women in society. It can be put into practice by reducing the impact of a patriarchal mindset. Aside from this, educating women about their rights and the significance of their involvement in politics is crucial. Women's political participation can be increased with the support of awareness campaigns and educational efforts.

By guaranteeing that more women are elected, reforms like the introduction of **preferential voting** and **proportional representation** can contribute to the increase of women's representation in politics. To keep the ratio stable, these are the only adjustments that can be made in the women's favor.
