- Prisma schema unchanged
- All existing migrations compatible

## üöÄ New Features

### Google Cloud Storage Integration

1. **File Upload Functions**
   - `uploadFile()` - Upload files to GCS with automatic path generation
   - `deleteFile()` - Delete files from GCS with error handling
   - `getSignedUrl()` - Generate signed URLs for private file access
   - `getPublicUrl()` - Generate public URLs for public bucket access
   - `listFiles()` - List files in buckets with optional prefix filtering

2. **Bucket Management**
   - Separate buckets for different file types
   - Configurable bucket names via environment variables
   - Public access for blog content, private for resumes

3. **Public vs Private Access**
   - **Blog Images & Attachments**: Public access using direct URLs
   - **Resumes**: Private access using signed URLs
   - **Performance**: Public URLs are faster and don't require authentication

4. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling for all storage operations
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing files
   - Detailed logging for debugging

### Migration Script

The migration script (`scripts/migrate-to-gcp.js`) provides:
- Configuration verification
- Data migration from Supabase URLs to GCS URLs
- Default service and plan creation
- Progress reporting and error handling

## üîí Security Improvements

1. **Service Account Authentication**
   - Secure service account key management
   - Principle of least privilege for IAM roles
   - Environment-based configuration

2. **Public vs Private Access Control**
   - Blog content is publicly accessible for better performance
   - Resume files remain private with signed URL access
   - Clear separation of public and private content

3. **Bucket-Level Security**
   - Public buckets for blog content (images, attachments)
   - Private buckets for sensitive files (resumes)
   - Proper CORS configuration for web access

## üéØ Performance Improvements

1. **Public URL Access**
   - Blog images and attachments load faster with direct URLs
   - No authentication overhead for public content
   - Better caching and CDN compatibility

2. **Reduced API Calls**
   - No need to generate signed URLs for blog content
   - Simplified frontend code for image display
   - Better user experience with faster loading

## üîß Testing

1. **Public URL Test Endpoint**
   - `/api/test-public-urls` - Verify public URL generation
   - Tests bucket configuration and URL format
   - Helps debug URL generation issues

2. **File Upload Testing**
   - Blog image and attachment uploads work with public URLs
   - Resume uploads still use signed URLs for privacy
   - Proper error handling for failed uploads

## üìä Migration Status

‚úÖ **Completed:**

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Local Development
- Use service account key file for authentication
- Public URLs work immediately without authentication
- Signed URLs require proper service account setup

### Production Deployment
- Cloud Run uses attached service account automatically
- No key file needed in production
- Public URLs work seamlessly
- Private files (resumes) use signed URLs with service account

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Public URL Access**
   - Verify bucket permissions are set to public
   - Check CORS configuration for web access
   - Ensure bucket names match environment variables

2. **Signed URL Issues**
   - Verify service account has proper permissions
   - Check service account key file path
   - Ensure `client_email` is present in key file

3. **File Upload Problems**
   - Check bucket permissions and CORS settings
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Test with the public URL test endpoint

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Test public URL generation
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-public-urls

# Test GCP authentication
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-gcp-auth

# Check bucket permissions
gsutil iam get gs://your-bucket-name
```

## üìà Benefits of Public Buckets
